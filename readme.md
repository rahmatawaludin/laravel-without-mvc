Simple crud application writen in Laravel. For sake of learning, I don't use many Laravel feature such as MVC, Migration or Seeding.

To install :

1. Download/fork this repository.
2. Make sure you have composer installed, then in project directory run `composer install`.
3. Setup database by importing `store.sql` to your database and configure database connection in `app/config/database.php`
4. Setup virtualhost for `app/public`.
5. Access App on your virtualhost.
6. Done.
